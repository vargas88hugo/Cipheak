# Cipheak - Spreading languages among the cosmos

## Description
On the technical side, we have developed an algorithm that creates affixes and natures from other words, which have been cleaned and parsed for their subsequent concatanation. Mostly it has been used object oriented programming with a composition approach, in a class hierarchy that ends in the main LanguageCreator class. At the beginning, efficiency was an issue, it was solved by balancing time complecity with space complexity and implementing regular expressions. Basically, this algorithm uses parsing, concatanation and random generation to build a language with root words from other languages.
